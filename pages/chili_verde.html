    <h1>Pork Green Chili</h1>
    <h2>The GOAT</h2>
    <img src="../images/chili.JPG">
    <p>Regarding the pickled red onions I used on top of my chili: Slice some red onions, add a pinch of salt, and cover with red wine vinegar. Leave this overnight in your fridge, and the next day you’ll be looking at one of the most gorgeous garnishes ever. They’re wonderful with everything from salads, to charcuterie, to cheeseburgers; but my real hope is that you enjoy them on a bowl of this delicious green pork chili. I really hope you give it a try soon. Enjoy!</p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>2 tablespoons vegetable oil</li>
        <li>2 pounds boneless pork shoulder, cut into 2-inch pieces</li>
        <li>1 yellow onion, diced</li>
        <li>2 teaspoons kosher salt, or to taste, divided</li>
        <li>2 teaspoons dried oregano</li>
        <li>2 teaspoons ground cumin</li>
        <li>½ teaspoon ground coriander</li>
        <li>¼ teaspoon cayenne pepper</li>
        <li>10 fresh tomatillos, removed from husks and rinsed</li>
        <li>3 jalapeño chile peppers, seeded</li>
        <li>1 poblano chile pepper, seeded</li>
        <li></li>
        <li></li><li></li>

6 cloves peeled garlic

½ cup packed cilantro leaves

2 ½ cups chicken stock, or as needed

1 bay leaf

1 ½ pounds Yukon Gold potatoes, quartered

freshly ground black pepper to taste

¼ cup sour cream

1/2 cup pickled red onions (Optional)

1 tablespoon chopped fresh cilantro

    </ul>

    Heat oil in a pot over high heat until nearly smoking. Add pork cubes in a single layer. Let sear until brown on one side, 4 to 5 minutes. Mix, turning pieces over to brown on the other side, 4 to 5 minutes. Add onion and 1/2 teaspoon kosher salt. Cook and stir until onion is translucent, about 4 minutes. Add oregano, cumin, coriander, and cayenne; cook and stir until seasonings are fragrant, about 2 minutes. Reduce the heat to low.

Cut tomatillos into quarters. Place into a blender with chili peppers, garlic, and cilantro. Add chicken stock. Pulse on and off until pieces start to break down, then blend until mixture has liquefied, about 30 seconds.

Stir sauce into pork mixture. Add 1 teaspoon kosher salt and bay leaf. Increase the heat to high and bring to a boil. Reduce the heat to low and maintain a slow but steady simmer for about 1 hour. Add potatoes, remaining 1/2 teaspoon kosher salt, and black pepper. If the mixture has reduced to where potatoes are not immersed, add more broth to cover. Simmer until pork and potatoes are tender, 45 minutes to 1 hour.

Garnish individual servings with a dollop of sour cream, some pickled red onions, and cilantro.
