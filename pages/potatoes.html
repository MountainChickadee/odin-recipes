    <h2>A Creamy Crusty Blast from the Past</h2>
    <img src="../images/pot_pic.JPG">
    <p>A truely unique way to enjoy the classic pantry staple, potatoes. They taste amazing, and the texture this method provides is unlike anything you get by just roasting. The way the crusty, crunchy edges outside, works with the uniquely rich and creamy inside is truly a magical thing.</p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <h4>Makes 6 potatoes</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>2 tbsp vegetable oil</li>
        <li>3 large russet potatoes</li>
        <li>salt and pepper to taste</li>
        <li>a knob of butter (a 2 or 3 tablespoon size chunk)</li>
        <li>4 thyme sprigs</li>
        <li>1/2 cup chicken broth or stock, more if needed</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Directions</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 200C/400F</li>
        <li>Peel the potatoes and slice the ends off, so they’re flat</li>
        <li>Cut the potatoes into 2” tall cylinders</li>
        <li>Heat the oil on the hob (cooker-top) in an oven-proof frying pan on a high heat until hot. Place the potatoes in the pan, flat side down and cook for 5-6 minutes, until golden brown</li>
        <li>Turn the potatoes over, reduce the heat to medium-high and cook for a further 5-6 minutes, until golden brown</li>
        <li>Add the butter, garlic, and thyme and let the butter melt in the pan.</li>
        <li>Stir the garlic and thyme with the butter then baste the potatoes with the butter</li>
        <li>Remove the garlic (or it will burn) and pour the chicken stock around the potatoes. Pour it in slowly and carefully as it will bubble and may splash.</li>
        <li>Sprinkle the potatoes with the salt and pepper and place in the oven to cook for 35 minutes.</li>
        <li>Check the potatoes are tender (insert a sharp knife into one of the potatoes – it should slide in easily). If they’re not yet tender, place them back in the oven for a further 5-10 minutes. Top up with a splash of hot stock if the pan starts to look too dry</li>
        <li>Once tender, serve topped with sprigs of fresh thyme and a sprinkling of Maldon salt.</li>
    </ol>
